# Sliding Selection List
The goal is to develop an amazing library with the latest android library to make a nagivation based menu. The viewpager based animated pushed level by level list menu support both multiple and single selection. The library to resolve real time sliding selection list. This is the solution for integrated complex filter and location picker

## Features:
- [x] level based menu with recyclerview and viewpager
- [ ] custom transitions
- [ ] mulitple selection and single selection combinations

## Feature Sample App:
- [Applied HB Filte EZ](https://github.com/jjhesk/slideSelectionList/blob/master/SmartSelectionList/app/src/main/java/com/tradlulu/demoCollectionList/AppliedHBFilteEZ.java) for applied API application
- [Basic App Logic](https://github.com/jjhesk/slideSelectionList/blob/master/SmartSelectionList/app/src/main/java/com/tradlulu/demoCollectionList/AppliedHBFilter.java) for non-API simple implemenation

Applied with logic from HbSelectionFragment which is the enhanced flow logic from backward and forward selection list.


## implemenation
There is nothing to supprt Ecilipse. Sorry. No Ecilipse! Instead you can take a look at the gradle implementation
```gradle
repositories {
   maven { url 'http://dl.bintray.com/jjhesk/maven/' }
}

compile 'com.hkm.slideSelectionList:slideselection:1.0.0'

```
